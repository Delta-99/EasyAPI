# EasyAPI

EasyAPI is an in-game script library for Space Engineers that aims to make the programmable blocks easier to use.

## To build the script

Run build.bat on a windows computer.  It will combine all the sources and minify them using the included csharp minification app I created from a fork of the CSharp-Minifier project.  You can find the sources for that app at https://github.com/rockyjvec/CSharp-Minifier
